          CS160 is an introduction to Human Computer Interaction (HCI). You will learn to prototype, evaluate, and design a user interface. You will be expected to work within a group of four or five students in this project-based course. Your project topic will be proposed by your group and your project design and implementation will follow a human-centered process. The final result will be an interactive prototype of a novel user experience carefully tailored to the needs of your intended users.
          <br/><br/>
          In contrast to most of the other CS classes at Berkeley, CS160 does not primarily focus on particular algorithmic techniques or computer technologies. Instead, the focus of the course is on developing a broad set of skills needed for user-centered design. These skills include ideation, needs assessment, communication, rapid prototyping, algorithmic implementation and evaluation.

          This term's themes will be all things vacation, travel, adventure, and international culture.  As students come from across the country and across the globe to converge on Berkeley for its diverse summer offerings, we'll celebrate that diversity by designing some fun exploration apps!<br/><br/>
          What kind of app would be useful if you were in a museum in a foreign country?  How about if you went to visit your old-timey grandma in Idaho and needed to learn to help her churn butter?  If you just went to shop at Ranch 99 and couldn't figure out which vegetables to pick up for the awesome Asian recipe you were trying to cook?  If you found yourself on a beach in Cancun and needed to figure out how to order a sandwich?  How do these designs change if you <i>aren't</i> designing for yourself, but for a child, your great-uncle, or a recent immigrant to the country?

          We are fortunate to have access to a set of Android watches that we'll be using to create our interactions this semester.  Each group will need to have at least one Android device that can pair with the watches (we'll ensure this through our group assignments), and each group will be able to check out two watches near the beginning of the term.  We haven't yet finalized the particular watch we'll be using, but we'll post more when we do!
